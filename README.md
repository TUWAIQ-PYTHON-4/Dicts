- If the number is less or more than 10 numbers, print "This is invalid number".
- If the number contains letters or symbols, print "This is invalid number".

## Q2:Write a function that receives a list containing different numbers ex: [23, 0, 873, 0, 14, 50, 0], rearranges the list so that the zeros are the end of the list, and finally returns the arranged list.
